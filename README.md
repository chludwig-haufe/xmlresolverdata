# XML Resolver Data

The standard DTDs, schemas, and URIs that ship with the XML Resolver.

This repository contains the data files that are packaged up with the resolver.

For the Java release, these files and an associated catalog are in the
`xmlresolver` jar file with the `data` classifier.

For the C# release, these files and an associated catalog are in the
`XmlResolverData` assembly. (At least thatâ€™s the current plan.)

This repository is used as a subproject in the Java and C# repositories.
